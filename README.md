# End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline for Student Placement Prediction

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning pipeline developed to predict student placement outcomes based on CGPA and IQ scores. The project uses logistic regression for binary classification, taking studentsâ€™ academic and cognitive metrics to forecast their placement success.

## Files

- **end-to-end-ml.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire pipeline, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
- **placement.csv**: The dataset used in this project, consisting of CGPA, IQ, and placement status.
- **model.pkl**: The trained logistic regression model, saved for making predictions on new data.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: 
   - Loaded the data from `placement.csv`.
   - Dropped unnecessary columns and checked for null values.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Removed the `Unnamed: 0` column to clean the data for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized the relationship between CGPA and IQ scores relative to placement status.

4. **Modeling**:
   - Chose logistic regression for binary classification.
   - Trained the model on the data to predict placement outcomes.

5. **Evaluation and Prediction**:
   - Evaluated model performance on test data.
   - Saved the model as `model.pkl` for future use.

## Setup and Usage

## Dataset Details
`Columns:
  cgpa: CGPA of the student.
  iq: IQ score of the student.
  placement: Placement status (1 = placed, 0 = not placed).`
